This code was modified to remove inline comments.

Then in the "flipchem.f" file, comments were added to define the intent of 
variables passed to "CHEMION". These comments were added starting line 143:

Cf2py intent(out) OXPLUS
Cf2py intent(out) O2PLUS
Cf2py intent(out) NOPLUS
Cf2py intent(out) N2PLUS
Cf2py intent(out) NPLUS
Cf2py intent(out) NNO
Cf2py intent(out) N2D
Cf2py intent(out) ITERS

Then on line 2480, comments were added to define the intent of 
variables passed to "GETLTSZA":

Cf2py intent(out) SAT
Cf2py intent(out) SZA
Cf2py intent(out) DEC

The flipchem.pyf file was generated using:
    f2py -m _f_flipchem -h flipchem.pyf flipchem.f
